' overlooked : paula stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was neglected at the hospital . the coroner heard from a succession of doctors and nurses who said hayley 's rapid deterioration had come as a shock to them . mrs stevenson has told the inquest she begged nurses to move hayley into intensive care , but was repeatedly assured this was unnecessary . at one point , she even tried ` bribing ' a nurse with # 100 to pay more attention to hayley , who was born in northern ireland . mrs stevenson told coroner aidan cotter : ` i could not believe that hayley had just been left to deteriorate . all along the family had expressed their concerns about hayley 's breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done . ` all she did was sleep . i missed my little girl so much and i felt as though i had n't seen her eyes in so long , her big blue eyes . ' hayley was born with a hole in her heart and was recovering from surgery when complications arose . describing the awful moments as her daughter 's life ebbed away , she said : ` i saw that hayley was really gasping for breath . ` her eyes were panic-stricken and they started rolling back in her head . ` hayley looked awful , she was like a fish out of water . she was gasping and gasping for every breath . ' paula stevenson , seen here with a picture of her baby girl hayley , says the staff at birmingham children 's hospital failed ` abominably ' mrs stevenson said there were around 15 people in the room working to save her daughter . she said : ` all the time i was stroking her head and telling her she was the best wee girl in the world . ` they worked on her until their hands hurt . all i could see was the monitor flashing -lsb- cardiac -rsb- arrest . ` all the time i kept squeezing her hand gently just to see if she would squeeze it back . hayley never squeezed my hand back . it was cold and lifeless . ` after 19 minutes everyone had stopped looking at hayley and they were now all looking at me with pity in their eyes . ` at 20 minutes -lsb- a doctor -rsb- confirmed my worst fears . he said , `` sorry mum , we 've lost her . '' ` and all i could think about was that i was no longer a mummy because hayley was my only child and she was dead . i was in shock and utterly devastated . ` the treatment has led me to question how can the staff at birmingham children 's hospital fail hayley so abominably ? ' mrs stevenson and her husband bobby fullerton now live in australia , and have another daughter , one-year-old casey . the inquest was adjourned and is not expected to resume until september when expert medical witnesses are available .	 one-year-old hayley died after her lungs collapsed .   paula stevenson spent days trying to warn hospital staff about her daughter 's breathing problems .   she even tried ` bribing ' a nurse to get her to pay more attention .
